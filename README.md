# Linkhub-Bookmark-Manager
A bookmark manager web app
when i reload the page, i'm taken to the login screen for a brief moment before it takes me into the bookmarks
also there's too much static ness when buttons are clicked and the user has to wait to see if their action is being carried out
Recommend some good loading screen libraries or something we can use to show the user their request is being processed
